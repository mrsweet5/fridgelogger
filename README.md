# Fridge Logger

### Problem
As someone who cooks occasionally, I always have problems keeping track of items in my fridge. As a result, majority of my food items have to be thrown away as they are forgotten and spoilt.

### Solution

I have created a fridge logger app that logs the items inside my fridge - in different compartments such as the freezer, chiller, pantry and sauces with their expiry date. This way, I will be able to know whatâ€™s in my fridge.

### Explanation Of Technologies Used

### Approach Taken

- Creating new items to be added in the fridge database
- Sorting them out based on the location in fridge chosen
- Editing and deleting food item

---------------------------------------
### Unsolved Problems & Future Plans

- UI and UX (user know which location is selected etc.)
